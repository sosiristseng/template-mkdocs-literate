## Notebook execution and publish via continuous integration (CI)

In [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml), notebooks under the `docs` folder are executed in parallel, and then [mkdocs-material][] creates a beautiful website from Markdown files.

## Enable GitHub pages

Open your repository settings => Pages => GitHub Pages => Build and deployment => Source, select `GitHub actions`.

## Automatic dependency updates

###  Dependabot and Kodiak Bot

See [dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) configuration.

This repository also uses [Kodiak Bot](https://kodiakhq.com/docs/quickstart) to automatically merge updates. You might need to enable the Kodiak Bot APP.

### Julia dependencies

The Github workflow [update-manifest.yml](.github/workflows/update-manifest.yml) will regularly update Julia dependencies, make a PR with the updated packages, and automatically merge the updates if the notebooks are executed without error.

See [the instructions](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for how to trigger CI workflows in a PR. My repo uses a custom [GitHub APP](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens) to generate a token on the fly.

## Checking HTTP links

[linkcheck.yml](.github/workflows/linkcheck.yml) uses GitHub actions to regularly check if the web links in the notebooks are valid.
